# aws-resource-explorer-cli 
Searches AWS resources and launches them in the AWS console in your browser.

This is using the [Resource Explorer feature](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-resource-explorer-quickly-find-resources-in-your-aws-account/) and works similarly to typing `/Resource <your query>` in the AWS console search bar, but lets you do it in your terminal instead for increased productivity.

## Installation
```
npm i -g aws-resource-explorer-cli
```

## Query syntax
Please study the [AWS Resource Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html) documentation to get the most out of your searches.
